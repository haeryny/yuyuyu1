    "### Relational Operators\n",
    "There are multiple operators which are used to evaluate 2 variables. In pseudocode the relational operators are =, >, <, ≠, ≥, and ≤. Other languages use different formats to represent these operators. For example, Python uses != instead of ≠. These operators help determine the boolean value of a statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Logical Operators\n",
    "Logical operators allow for boolean values to be evaluated. Pseudocode uses the logical operators NOT, AND, and OR. Javascript uses the same logic, but uses different ways to represent the operators: &&(and), | |(or), |(not).\n",
    "\n",
    "Operators and booleans can be very useful, allowing a program to create an algorithm based on user inputs items stored in list. For example, operators can be used to perform multiple operations on lists.\n",

    "- We can use conditionals in algorithms in order to receive different outputs from a set of code, and help achieve the general purpose of the algorithm.\n",

    "Two broad types of conditional statements are if statements and if-else statements\n",

## Kathyleen Beveridge

She believes that in her life it is important to live with compassion. She graduated as a finance major but then switched her career to high-tech. She started at Qualcomm but switched to a more biotech company: Thermo Fisher Scientific. 

- HP Inc: Create technology that makes life better for everyone, everywhere.
- Qualcomm: Inventing the tech the world loves
- Thermo Fisher Scientific: Enable our customers to make the world healthier, cleaner, and safer.

They are all similar in the way where they want to help the world and the community around them. 

She prefers high-tech because they all want to improve the world and does not value money and likes how her current company makes a positive impact on the world.
